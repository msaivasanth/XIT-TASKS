After school, we went home and told our respective parents about
the incident. Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher, and in our
presence, told the teacher that he should not spread the poison of social
inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children.
He bluntly asked the teacher to either apologize or quit the school and
the island. Not only did the teacher regret his behaviour, but the strong
sense of conviction Lakshmana Sastry conveyed ultimately reformed
this young teacher.
